    This dashboard uses loan data from **Attom** (May 15, 2021 ‚Äì May 8, 2024) to analyze residential loans, with a focus on those approved by **Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs)**. We also incorporate the latest CDFI list from the [CDFI Fund website](https://www.cdfifund.gov/) as of **June 17, 2024**. Through this analysis, we explore:

    - When and where residential loans are being sought
    - Which CDFIs are most frequently approached
    - Loan amounts by CDFIs
    - Regional loan-seeking patterns
